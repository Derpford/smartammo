# Smart Ammo

A simple mod that causes the player to only pick up *part* of an ammo pickup when they can't carry it all.

Limitations:
- Regrettably, I can't alter the pickup message on an item, so I cannot change the item's pickup message to reflect the fact that its amount has changed.
- Some ammo pickups don't work and I don't know why. (So far, I've identified the small ammo pickups from *IronBound* as one of the problematic ones.)
